A. in  Comparative & Middle East Politics and Society (CMEPS) is a two-year masters program jointly offered by the University of Tübingen and the American University in Cairo (AUC). It provides in-depth knowledge of the political and societal developments in the Middle East as well as analytical tools for under-standing this regions complex dynamics and challenges.
The focal point of the degree program is the relationship between societies and states in the MENA region as well as the dynamics of social and political transformation. Key topics are Comparative Politics of the Middle East, development politics and international cooperation, as well as issues of regime change and democratization. Students can choose from a range of elective modules, concentrating, for example, on International Political Economy, Peace and Conflict Resolution, or on issues in Middle Eastern culture and civil societies. Depending on their first degree, students of the CMEPS program will also take courses in either Political Science methods or basic Arabic (or German, respectively) during their first year. Irrespective of their first degree, by the end of their studies CMEPS students will have a unique profile which combines an advanced analytical knowledge of Comparative Politics with a strong specialisation in the politics, society, cultures, and language of the Arab Middle East.
To promote the link between theory and practice, study trips to international organisations and development agencies as well as to important political and cultural institutions of the respective host country are included in the program.","Middle East Studies, Democratisation and Regime Change, Development Policy, International Cooperation, Comparative Political Science","Comparative & Middle East Politics and Society (CMEPS) | Political Science | Middle East Studies, Democratisation and Regime Change, Development Policy, International Cooperation, Comparative Political Science | The M.

Just recently a crisis originating in the financial sector has proved to have severe consequences for economies and societies worldwide. It is therefore of the utmost importance that managers in the financial sector, regulatory offices and central banks have a sound understanding of the theory and real-world processes of financial markets as well as of financial instruments designed for risk sharing. Graduating from this program, you will be able to apply econometric methods to analyse financial data and to assess the validity of theoretical predictions and scientific forecasts for the financial sector. You will understand how prices of risky assets are (or should be) determined. And you will understand why financial instruments can increase social welfare, even though they may involve considerable risks for individual investors and society as a whole. In addition to field courses focusing on these issues, you may choose complementary elective courses according to your own preferences.
Graduating from this program is a first step towards an ambitious professional career in private and public institutions.

The combination of empirical research with theoretical modelling is an internationally renowned hallmark of linguistics in Tübingen.
There is a long tradition of Linguistics in Tübingen, but there are more linguists now working on a wider variety of aspects of linguistics than ever before. In part, this is due to the exceptional success of Tübingen linguists in attracting research funding over the last 20 years. The course structure of the M. A. program English Linguistics reflects this depth and interdisciplinarity. While there is an emphasis on the description and processing of the English language, perspectives are always enriched by crosslinguistic comparison and interdisciplinary approaches ranging from experimentation to literary studies. For this reason, students can combine courses offered in English Linguistics with selected M. A. courses offered by the other Linguistics departments.
An important aspect of the M. A. program is the degree of choice in independent study. From the very beginning, students are encouraged to design and conduct their own research projects. Supervised by staff, they can contribute to the ongoing research of the Institute of English Languages and Literatures, and joint publications with staff are often the result.

Our M.Sc. in General Management provides a perfect balance between rigorous academic theory and application-oriented best practice, as needed for successful management. It offers a comprehensive portfolio of courses providing both, breadth and depth. More general core courses in Business Studies pave the ground for flexible, in-depth specialization in various management disciplines, such as such as Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, International Business, Marketing or Taxes. Students may also aim at complementary specialization in certain areas of Economics, benefiting from a strong Economics group in the School. Modern management increasingly draws on knowledge from neighbouring fields, such as Law, Psychology, Sociology or Statistics. Our program builds on this up-to-date approach of management education. It is therefore characterized by a high degree of flexibility and openness and offers a large set of elective courses within the area of management and beyond.

The M.Sc. Programme in Management & Economics offers a unique education that combines state-of-the-art management tools with game-theoretic concepts.
Managers of today's firms operate in a global environment and must be prepared to quickly react to changing business and market conditions, competitors actions, and internal governance problems. The Management & Economics programme gives students extensive insights in business and market environments with a core focus on managerial economics, personnel economics, and industrial organization.
The courses offered in the programme deal with the strategic behaviour of competing firms and focus on implementing management tools within the firms to provide an informational basis for successful business strategies, show how to use the firms accounting system for decision-making purposes, and account for potential information asymmetries. Moreover, students learn how to select appropriate performance measures, design efficient incentive systems, and develop strategies to build up and maintain the human capital needed in the firm.
Students of this programme develop analytical and professional skills and learn how to apply advanced methods of game theory and principal-agent-theory to understand the implications of strategic interaction among different players.
The M.Sc. in Management & Economics is designed as a 3-semester programme, taught according to the European Credit Transfer System. Successful completion requires students to achieve a total of 90 ECTS credits.
Compulsory courses teach the essentials of management and economics and emphasize the link between both areas. Specialization studies allow students to specialize according to their individual interests and abilities. Electives can be chosen from courses in business studies and in economics.

The basic idea is to provide motivated students with the greatest possible freedom and flexibility in combination with softskill training and interdisciplinary networking, a self-determined, research-oriented course. We provide a friendly and creative learning environment and seek to best assist our students on their path to academic excellence. The experience of recent years shows that motivated people achieve the best performance and success in a flexible environment. Rules and regulations slow down one's own motivation and reduce the level of success. Therefore, we always try to be as flexible and individual as possible for each of our students.
Since we want to promote each student individually, the research degree program begins in the third or fourth semester. Prospective students complete the first two or three semesters in a regular undergraduate course in Physics at any university. In these semesters, those interested learn the basics needed and get used to the everyday university life. 
The research phase begins at the earliest after the sixth semester. It is possible to combine the Master's thesis with the directly following PhD. To this end, the students select a research field for the Master's thesis, which can be expanded to a doctorate, if desired. After completing the Master's thesis, they receive the Master's degree and a certificate from the Elite Network of Bavaria. Then they complete the doctoral project.

But can well-being be achieved without health at all? Or is well-being a necessary condition for health? And how can well-being and / or health be achieved through exercise? These are just a few of the questions we will discuss with you in this hands-on, inclusive Masters program. 
Our understanding of how well-being can be achieved is strongly influenced by our cultural backgrounds. In addition to the Western-oriented approaches to achieving well-being, a focal point of this study program is on Far Eastern alternatives for achieving well-being: During two stays abroad, we offer you the opportunity to study the basics and applications of Ayurveda and Yoga as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Qigong at partner universities in India and China. 
In order to assess the diverse effects of these Western and Far Eastern approaches to well-being, you will also gain insights into the most up-to-date scientific methods in the fields of cognitive psychology, movement, training and neuroscience and use these in their own research projects and internships. These include the measurement of brain states based on brain electromagnetic and hemodynamic activity, effects on various heart rate dependent variables, changes in skin resistance, variations in the infrared spectrum or changes in gas discharge. 
Courses on health psychology, occupational health management (BGM) and the influence of different nutritional concepts round off a study program that is so far unique in Europe in this form. 
Our goal is to provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to critically reflect, scientifically review and assess a wide range of well-being pathways. In this study program you will acquire the necessary competencies to offer, for example, a holistic analysis and therapy recommendations for athletes in clubs and training centres and in cooperation with physicians for patients, to advise in the field of health management and to organise events or to train in the field of medical assistance professions. Of course, you can also opt for a postgraduate program / doctoral program.","System dynamics of movement and well-being, Nutrition, Health Psychology, Applied Sports Psychology, Ayurveda and Yoga, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong, Performance Diagnostics, Neurosciences, Statistics and data analysis, Corporate Health Management","Sport Science - Movement and Well-Being | Sports Science | System dynamics of movement and well-being, Nutrition, Health Psychology, Applied Sports Psychology, Ayurveda and Yoga, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong, Performance Diagnostics, Neurosciences, Statistics and data analysis, Corporate Health Management | Well-being is much more than just the absence of illness.
