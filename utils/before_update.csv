The program consists of four core aspects:
American Literature and Culture
- Interdisciplinary Profile
- Research
- Practice
Within this structure, students are exposed to the fundamental theoretical framework of American Studies while completing collaborative and independent research projects.
Each year, our department welcomes a number of esteemed guest professors from international universities. Teaching lectures and seminars, our guests bring new and innovative research and perspectives to students of American Studies.
All students of American Studies are encouraged to spend time in an English-speaking country. This is an invaluable opportunity for students to work with experienced professionals in a different academic environment.",

Literature is therefore viewed as an integral part of the culture of the modern era, in the widest sense of the phrase encompassing cultural developments from the Middle Ages to the post-modern era. More recent developments in the field, built on the concept of literary studies as a form of media studies and cultural studies, form the basis for exploring the relationship between literary texts and other types of text and media, thus creating a productive link between literary and cultural studies. The ability to critically analyse and reflect on texts of any kind constitutes the core principle underlying teaching and learning in this area.
A Masters degree in English Studies will prepare students for jobs predominantly (but not exclusively) in the areas of public relations, adult education, intercultural communication, and in similar career fields where a strong background in communicative and intercultural skills, in addition to excellent foreign language skills, plays a crucial role.",

Although the Institute for Natural Science Archaeology was officially founded only in 2007, this area already has a long and excellent tradition at the University of Tübingen. As early as 1896, Ernst Koken taught human evolution and prehistory at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Since then, numerous courses in Natural Science Archaeology have been taught in Tübingen. For many decades Tübingen was the only German university with an archaeology department within a faculty of natural sciences. Over the past decades, Natural Science Archaeology in Tübingen has been closely linked to the Chair of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology and that of Bioarchaeology. In recent years, a chair for archaeometry and two new junior professorships have been set up at the Institute of Natural Science Archaeology. The institute is divided into six pillars: archaeometry, archaeobotany, geoarchaeology, palaeoanthropology, palaeogenetics and zoo archaeology.",

A. in  Comparative & Middle East Politics and Society (CMEPS) is a two-year masters program jointly offered by the University of Tübingen and the American University in Cairo (AUC). It provides in-depth knowledge of the political and societal developments in the Middle East as well as analytical tools for under-standing this regions complex dynamics and challenges.
The focal point of the degree program is the relationship between societies and states in the MENA region as well as the dynamics of social and political transformation. Key topics are Comparative Politics of the Middle East, development politics and international cooperation, as well as issues of regime change and democratization. Students can choose from a range of elective modules, concentrating, for example, on International Political Economy, Peace and Conflict Resolution, or on issues in Middle Eastern culture and civil societies. Depending on their first degree, students of the CMEPS program will also take courses in either Political Science methods or basic Arabic (or German, respectively) during their first year. Irrespective of their first degree, by the end of their studies CMEPS students will have a unique profile which combines an advanced analytical knowledge of Comparative Politics with a strong specialisation in the politics, society, cultures, and language of the Arab Middle East.
To promote the link between theory and practice, study trips to international organisations and development agencies as well as to important political and cultural institutions of the respective host country are included in the program.","Middle East Studies, Democratisation and Regime Change, Development Policy, International Cooperation, Comparative Political Science"

Data scientists must be able to acquire and understand complex and unstructured data, they must be able to interpret the meaning of the results, and they must be able to communicate the results to relevant stakeholders. Hence, Data Science requires a unique combination of (1) econometrics and statistics, (2) programming skills, and (3) domain knowledge.
This four-semester M.Sc. program reflects these requirements for a unique skill set, and students who enrol in this programme specialize in econometrics and they select from a broad set of modules on different aspects of business and economics. On top of that, they enrol in modules on data science techniques, which includes programming in R and python as well as the possibility to enrol in courses in Machine Learning in collaboration with the computer science department.

Sc. in Economics and Finance combines the strengths of our faculty in Econometrics and Finance. Just recently a crisis originating in the financial sector has proved to have severe consequences for economies and societies worldwide. It is therefore of the utmost importance that managers in the financial sector, regulatory offices and central banks have a sound understanding of the theory and real-world processes of financial markets as well as of financial instruments designed for risk sharing. Graduating from this program, you will be able to apply econometric methods to analyse financial data and to assess the validity of theoretical predictions and scientific forecasts for the financial sector. You will understand how prices of risky assets are (or should be) determined. And you will understand why financial instruments can increase social welfare, even though they may involve considerable risks for individual investors and society as a whole. In addition to field courses focusing on these issues, you may choose complementary elective courses according to your own preferences.
Graduating from this program is a first step towards an ambitious professional career in private and public institutions.
To allow for tailor-made personal curricula and research agendas, each program features specialization courses. You may choose to further your specialization in a certain field or to broaden your education by attending courses of a complementary nature, including interdisciplinary elements.
We place great emphasis on active student involvement. Attending a Master seminar, you will earn credits by writing a research paper on a topical issue of Economics, Econometrics or Finance, and by presenting your paper in class. Most importantly, you will write a Master thesis on a topic agreed upon between yourself and your thesis supervisor. Working on your thesis under the dedicated supervision of a faculty member will allow you, with due effort, to move up to the frontier of academic research. In doing so, you will acquire methodological skills and expertise that greatly enhance your career perspectives, including a possible continuation of your education in an excellent Ph. D. program.",

A. program English Linguistics provides a full understanding of current linguistics and a thorough training in the empirical methods used in linguistic research. The combination of empirical research with theoretical modelling is an internationally renowned hallmark of linguistics in Tübingen.
There is a long tradition of Linguistics in Tübingen, but there are more linguists now working on a wider variety of aspects of linguistics than ever before. In part, this is due to the exceptional success of Tübingen linguists in attracting research funding over the last 20 years. The course structure of the M. A. program English Linguistics reflects this depth and interdisciplinarity. While there is an emphasis on the description and processing of the English language, perspectives are always enriched by crosslinguistic comparison and interdisciplinary approaches ranging from experimentation to literary studies. For this reason, students can combine courses offered in English Linguistics with selected M. A. courses offered by the other Linguistics departments.
An important aspect of the M. A. program is the degree of choice in independent study. From the very beginning, students are encouraged to design and conduct their own research projects. Supervised by staff, they can contribute to the ongoing research of the Institute of English Languages and Literatures, and joint publications with staff are often the result. The academic and empirical skills thus acquired provide students with excellent qualifications for further study in Linguistics at doctoral level.
In recent international and national ratings, Linguistics in Tübingen fared very well. For example, in the QS World University Ranking, Linguistics is in the worlds top 100.",

What can B.Sc. graduates do to achieve a competitive edge? We suggest: An M.Sc. in General Management from Tübingen University   a degree program highly sought after by applicants and greatly respected by employers.
Our M.Sc. in General Management provides a perfect balance between rigorous academic theory and application-oriented best practice, as needed for successful management. It offers a comprehensive portfolio of courses providing both, breadth and depth. More general core courses in Business Studies pave the ground for flexible, in-depth specialization in various management disciplines, such as such as Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, International Business, Marketing or Taxes. Students may also aim at complementary specialization in certain areas of Economics, benefiting from a strong Economics group in the School. Modern management increasingly draws on knowledge from neighbouring fields, such as Law, Psychology, Sociology or Statistics. Our program builds on this up-to-date approach of management education. It is therefore characterized by a high degree of flexibility and openness and offers a large set of elective courses within the area of management and beyond. This will enable our students to acquire knowledge, expertise and skills tailored to their preferences and in line with the requirements of their intended career path. The curriculum also offers a  Ph.D. track mode of graduation for those students who wish to pursue a doctorate.",

Since 2012, we offer this program which is unique in German graduate education: students will study the M. Sc. in International Business in their first year at the University of Tübingen and in their second year at one or two of the most prestigious universities either in East Asia or in Africa.

They continue their studies attending management courses as official exchange students at the Business Schools or Faculties of these universities. Students also write their Master thesis while abroad.
In their first year at Tübingen University students of the M.Sc. in International Business can choose among the same management courses as their peers studying the M.Sc. in General Management. In addition, as for the East Asia track, they will take pertinent country-specific and language courses. In their second year, students will continue their management studies at one or two of the partner universities. The courses at the partner universities will be taught in English\; optionally, students may continue taking language courses in the host country language. While studying at the partner universities the students write their Master thesis.
The M. Sc. in International Business is designed as a 4-semester program, taught according to the European Credit Transfer System. Successful completion requires students to achieve a total of 120 ECTS credits (including the Master thesis of 18 ECTS credits).",

Students will attend lectures, seminars, and project lab courses under the supervision of scientists who introduce them to basic and applied research and current topics in machine learning.
To pick up on scientific trends and make the best use of the current state of research, the curriculum relies heavily on the strong research presence on site, in machine learning as well as the wider field of computer science: top-level researchers in all major methodological branches of machine learning are present in Tübingen – personnel that will actively engage in teaching for the Master’s Program Machine Learning. Since the field is obviously very young and currently developing extremely rapidly, training will naturally be based on the most recent insights and the most pressing research questions of these teaching researchers. Project work and the Master’s thesis will offer students the opportunity to develop code for research purposes and their own scientific projects.

The M.Sc. Programme in Management & Economics offers a unique education that combines state-of-the-art management tools with game-theoretic concepts.
Managers of today's firms operate in a global environment and must be prepared to quickly react to changing business and market conditions, competitors actions, and internal governance problems. The Management & Economics programme gives students extensive insights in business and market environments with a core focus on managerial economics, personnel economics, and industrial organization.
The courses offered in the programme deal with the strategic behaviour of competing firms and focus on implementing management tools within the firms to provide an informational basis for successful business strategies, show how to use the firms accounting system for decision-making purposes, and account for potential information asymmetries. Moreover, students learn how to select appropriate performance measures, design efficient incentive systems, and develop strategies to build up and maintain the human capital needed in the firm.
Students of this programme develop analytical and professional skills and learn how to apply advanced methods of game theory and principal-agent-theory to understand the implications of strategic interaction among different players.
The M.Sc. in Management & Economics is designed as a 3-semester programme, taught according to the European Credit Transfer System. Successful completion requires students to achieve a total of 90 ECTS credits.
Compulsory courses teach the essentials of management and economics and emphasize the link between both areas. Specialization studies allow students to specialize according to their individual interests and abilities. Electives can be chosen from courses in business studies and in economics.
Successful completion of the programme also requires students to attend a Ph.D.-oriented seminar (6 ECTS credits) and to write a master thesis in English or German during their third and final semester.",

At the heart of this specialisation is the in-depth scientific examination of molecular mechanisms that control the functions and behaviour of cells and lead to diseases when they are defective. Experimental objects of investigation are model organisms such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis and cell cultures of animal or human single cells. Knowledge or derivations are derived from experimental results, for example, about cell functions in cell aggregation, cell differentiation or organ development. The immunological processes are considered in particular in relation to disease-related malfunctions, such as are shown in immune defects or tumour immunology.

The focus of the Master's programme is both the exploratory and the trial-based learning of peace studies contexts. On the one hand, the dynamics, processes and structures of violent conflicts are to be analysed, and this analysis extended by practice-relevant experiences. On the other hand, it is about getting to know the opportunities and possibilities of cooperation for coping with international and internal violent conflicts. Based on methodologically and theoretically sound basic research, concepts, institutions and strategies of violence prevention and peaceful conflict management are critically reviewed, designed and developed further. The course also provides insights into the ethical issues of international politics and teaches peace as the normative value of professional and especially academic work.
Particularly noteworthy are the possibilities of practical learning in the form of excursions, such as in connection with security policy in Europe, to Vienna, Strasbourg and Brussels, the 'Peace Boat' with a stay aboard the floating university and the approach to conflict regions or simulation and excursion to the National Model United Nations in New York. In addition, numerous seminars are held by lecturers from the field, such as the Institute for Peace Education.
The courses can be studied both in German and in English.",

The basic idea is to provide motivated students with the greatest possible freedom and flexibility in combination with softskill training and interdisciplinary networking, a self-determined, research-oriented course. We provide a friendly and creative learning environment and seek to best assist our students on their path to academic excellence. The experience of recent years shows that motivated people achieve the best performance and success in a flexible environment. Rules and regulations slow down one's own motivation and reduce the level of success. Therefore, we always try to be as flexible and individual as possible for each of our students.
Since we want to promote each student individually, the research degree program begins in the third or fourth semester. Prospective students complete the first two or three semesters in a regular undergraduate course in Physics at any university. In these semesters, those interested learn the basics needed and get used to the everyday university life. 
The research phase begins at the earliest after the sixth semester. It is possible to combine the Master's thesis with the directly following PhD. To this end, the students select a research field for the Master's thesis, which can be expanded to a doctorate, if desired. After completing the Master's thesis, they receive the Master's degree and a certificate from the Elite Network of Bavaria. Then they complete the doctoral project.

But can well-being be achieved without health at all? Or is well-being a necessary condition for health? And how can well-being and / or health be achieved through exercise? These are just a few of the questions we will discuss with you in this hands-on, inclusive Masters program. 
Our understanding of how well-being can be achieved is strongly influenced by our cultural backgrounds. In addition to the Western-oriented approaches to achieving well-being, a focal point of this study program is on Far Eastern alternatives for achieving well-being: During two stays abroad, we offer you the opportunity to study the basics and applications of Ayurveda and Yoga as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Qigong at partner universities in India and China. 
In order to assess the diverse effects of these Western and Far Eastern approaches to well-being, you will also gain insights into the most up-to-date scientific methods in the fields of cognitive psychology, movement, training and neuroscience and use these in their own research projects and internships. These include the measurement of brain states based on brain electromagnetic and hemodynamic activity, effects on various heart rate dependent variables, changes in skin resistance, variations in the infrared spectrum or changes in gas discharge. 
Courses on health psychology, occupational health management (BGM) and the influence of different nutritional concepts round off a study program that is so far unique in Europe in this form. 
Our goal is to provide you with the knowledge and skills needed to critically reflect, scientifically review and assess a wide range of well-being pathways. In this study program you will acquire the necessary competencies to offer, for example, a holistic analysis and therapy recommendations for athletes in clubs and training centres and in cooperation with physicians for patients, to advise in the field of health management and to organise events or to train in the field of medical assistance professions. Of course, you can also opt for a postgraduate program / doctoral program.","System dynamics of movement and well-being, Nutrition, Health Psychology, Applied Sports Psychology, Ayurveda and Yoga, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong, Performance Diagnostics, Neurosciences, Statistics and data analysis, Corporate Health Management"
